# Go Data Structures & Algorithms

> A collection of data structures and algorithms implemented in Go for personal reference and education.

## Data Structures

### Abstraction

#### List

* Linked List
* Dynamic Array

#### Queue

* [Stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)) - A stack can be easily implemented either through an array or a linked list. What identifies the data structure as a stack in either case is not the implementation but the interface: the user is only allowed to pop or push items onto the array or linked list, with few other helper operations.

#### Map

* Tree Map
* Hash Map / Hash Table
