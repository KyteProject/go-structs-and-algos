# Go Data Structures & Algorithms

> A collection of data structures and algorithms implemented in Go for personal reference and education.

## Data Structures

Bellow are a list of common data-structures created in Go with tests, implementations are grouped by abstraction and link to their associated wikipedia entry.

* ### List

  * Linked List
  * Dynamic Array

* ### Queue

  * [Stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)) - A stack can be easily implemented either through an array or a linked list. What identifies the data structure as a stack in either case is not the implementation but the interface: the user is only allowed to pop or push items onto the array or linked list, with few other helper operations.

* ### Map

  * Tree Map
  * Hash Map / Hash Table
